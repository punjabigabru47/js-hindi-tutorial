javaScript execution Context

step one: Global execution context has been created and put in "this" variable in browser.

-> global execution context
-> functional execution context
-> eval execution context

-> two phases of execution
  1. memory creation phase
  2. execution phase

1. when we run any code in js fist this happens is "global execution and allocate
    in "this" variable in browser enviornment.
2. memory creation phase-
    we declare all the variables and their first value by default is "undefined"
    and any function stored as defined or definition.
    even the results are alse undefined in memory creation phase.
3. execution phase-
   1. first thing happens assigns the values to variables we created which were 
      undefined bydefault and in execution phase we assigne them a value.
